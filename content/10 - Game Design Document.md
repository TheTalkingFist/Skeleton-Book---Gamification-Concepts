We need a map. By the end of this lesson, you should be able to understand what a GDD is, its purpose and its components.

# So, what is a Game Design Document (GDD)?

A GDD is a document that **describes, in detail**, all of **the characters, levels, game mechanics, views, menus and all other components of the game**. It also describes the planned **functional requirements** for the team to implement for the project.


The people who are concerned of the GDD are:
- The producer, who preaches the goal.
	- In charge of overseeing development.
- The designers, who champion their ideas.
	- Designs gameplay, rules and structure.
- The artists and writers, who get their instructions.
	- Artists produce the art assets.
	- Programmers write the code for.


**The purpose** of a GDD is to express **the vision for the game, describe the contents and present a plan** for implementation.



So, who makes the GDD?

- Really, it's a team effort.
	- Each person, based on their own expertise, can contribute to the Document.

It's important to note that the existence of the GDD does not disqualify the need for meetings and discussions, and the GDD itself is a discussion piece as it allows team members to exchange ideas clearly and effectively.



The key components of game design are as follows:
- Overview
- Art
- Design
- Development
- Marketing
- Management

### Overview
This is where you establish what the game is about, the genre and theme, intended platform, target audience and storyline.

### Art
Establishing the art style, characters, environments and UI concept for the game. As well, you would list all of the art needed for the video game in here. It is _okay_ to add placeholder references to be defined at a later time.

Here, we'd also spell out the **characteristics, style, mood, colors, etc.**
- 2D Art & Animation
- Special Effects (Explosions, sparks, etc.)
- 3D Art & Animation (Texture, etc.)
- Cinematics (Cutscenes, etc.)
- Video

### Design
Establish the different levels of a game and elaborate on the gameplay (Objectives, Goals and Challenges) for each level as well as the type of sound and music design for the game.


### Control Mechanics and GUI
For the UI, we'd have:
- a flowchart for screen and window interaction
- a breakdown of the functional requirements of all screens and windows.

As for the GUI objects:
- Programmers will get their instructions for which pieces of the GUI need to be coded, as well as how they are put together such as buttons, pointers, sliders, icons, etc.

Mockups:
- These are a good starting point for artists.
- These are gonna have to be kept simple; lineart with text drawings are alright.

### Development
This establishes the the gameplay mechanics, systems and controls needed for the game.

### Marketing
This is where discussion of marketing strats, graphics/videos and timeline of launch and marketing happens.

### Management
...is where the budget, schedule and needed talents for specific parts of the game are worked out.
