There are 3 main ways we can classify video games.

- Genre
- Art Style
- Platform

For example, Overwatch is an **Action/FPS** game with a **Sci-Fi art style** and theme, and is available on **PC and Consoles**.



## Genre

Genre is used to classify the type of **gameplay interaction** between the user and the game, as well as how the game's mechanics carry out. **Games may also happen to belong to multiple genres** at the same time.

A few examples of major video game genres are:

- Action
- Puzzle
- Educational
- Sports
- Strategy
- Adventure
- Role-playing (RPG)
- Racing
- Simulation
- Hybrid

Since the introduction of 3D Gaming, Hybrid games have evolved to include Real-time control of gameplay elements as well as puzzle-solving. (???)

	- One of the most successful examples of a hybrid is action-adventure, which are mostly with some qualities of adventures (For example, The Legend of Zelda with story and puzzles).

- Horror
- Fantasy
- Sci-Fi
- Historical
- Cute


### Horror

Where the aesthetics are meant to create a sense of horror to scare the player. Lighting and sounds play a huge part in perfecting the atmosphere of horror games, as well as a usually realistic environment.

### Fantasy

A fictional world where magic, wizards and stuff awaits! These are usually incorporated as a game mechanic too.

These usually have bright colors and vibrant graphics.

E.G: The Legend of Zelda


### Sci-Fi

Fictional, just like Fantasy, but with science, space and technology instead, all in a futuristic environment

E.G: Borderlands


### Historical

Based on historical settings (obv), it recreates the era, places, culture and events of the set era. 

E.G: Dynasty Warriors


### Cute

Featuring stylised characters and environment, this one usually appeals to a younger target audience.
