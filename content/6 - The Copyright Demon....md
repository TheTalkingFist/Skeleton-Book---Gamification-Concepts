Originality might be overrated, but that (unfortunately, to some) doesn't mean we can just steal stuff from other people.

By the end of this topic, you hopefully should be able to explain the terms "Copyright", "Trademark", "Plagiarism", and "Digital Rights Management (DRM)"

So, what exactly is **copyright**?

## Copyright

Copyright is the **exclusive right** given to an **author** to **reproduce, publish, communicate, and adapt** their work. This bundle of rights lets the creator have **control** over the **commercial exploitation** of their work.

As a copyright holder, you would have the sole right to distribute derivative works based off of an original. This includes stuff like sequels, and any other work that includes copyright-able elements from the OG.


### What about in Singapore?

Generally, copyright covers things like literary, music, computer games and other stuff. For a work to be protected by copyright, it has to be **original** and **expressed in a tangible form**, like recording or writing.

Of course, though, copyright laws differ from country to country. In Singapore...

 - “Copyright protects works like literary, computer programs, plays, music and paintings.”​
	 - “For a work to be protected by copyright in Singapore, it has to be original and expressed in a tangible form, such as in a recording or in writing.”.​
	-  “Generally, the author of a copyright work has the right to reproduce, publish, perform, communicate and adapt his work.”​


## So, what does the law protect exactly?

- Literary
- Television programs
- Performances
- Sound recording
- Films
- Photography
- Published edition

Essentially, anything that has artistic value or had artistic ideas in play. The **expression** of ideas, and not the ideas themselves. Speaking of which...

## What does copyright *not* protect?

- Ideas / Concepts
- Discoveries
- Procedures
- Methods
- Unrecorded works
- Unoriginal works (e.g: fanfics)
- Procedures

Basically, things that are ambiguous.
```
ambiguous
/amˈbɪɡjʊəs/
_adjective_

1. open to more than one interpretation; not having one obvious meaning.
```

### Good to Know:
**Inventions** cannot be copyrighted, but they can instead be protected under _Patent_ laws

# Trademarks, Copyright's Corporate Brother

A Trademark is a sign you'd use to distinguish your business' goals, logos or slogans. Essentially, it is a Copyright for Businesses.

Trademarks can stay indefinitely, as long as you pay to renew it every 10 years.

In **Singapore, it is not compulsory** to register for a trademark, and may rely on **common law rights of "passing off"**. This prevents the a person or company from **misrepresentation** by another.

So, why get one?
### Benefits
They add value to a business by protecting their market share, as well as raising equity for the development of one's business via franchising or licensing.



## Infringement of Rights

This happens when someone **hasn't obtained consent from the copyright holder to do something.**

For the situation to become a real situation, the original holder will have to pursue the infringer. If the owner *does not choose to pursue*, they will lose the rights to the work or brand name (wait wtf is this actually true???????).


## Plagiarism

Plagiarism is when you take work or ideas from another source and pass it off as your own **without permission**. 

HBomberguy made a video about this recently.

Apparently Tencent (creators of League of Legends) sued the Moonton CEO for Mobile Legends. That's actually... kinda funny.

Anyway, that's now why they added the subtitle, making it Mobile Legends: Bang Bang.


## Plagiarism vs Copyright

Basically, Plagiarism is an **ethical** situation, while Copyright is a **legal** situation.

For plagiarism, if you don't get caught, you don't get sued.

For copyright, the creator has every right to bring you to court.


It's up to you which one is worse. Actually, don't infringe anything, it's better that way.

# The Digital Rights Management (DRM)

The DRM is a form of copyright management.

It refers to **access control technology** that can be used by **hardware manufacturers, publishers, copyright holders and individuals** to **limit the usage of digital content** and devices.

Essentially, it is technology that does not allow **the use of digital content not intended** by the original creator.


Back in the day, when CDs were the big way to distribute games, they came with a CD Key. When you were to boot up your Windows 98 system and chuck your CD in to install DOOM, you would have to key in a CD key that came with the box.

This is a form of DRM. A way to access control tech that can be used by hardware manufactures, publishers, copyright holders and individuals to control the distribution of software.

Another example is the iOS App Store and Apple Arcade, software from which is only allowed for iOS devices to run.

Another another example of this is Blizzard games, which prompt you to sign into Battle.net to play. This enables them to detect if you're playing a fake or pirated copy of the game.
