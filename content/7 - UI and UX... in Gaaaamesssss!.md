The last chapter was a bit random, honestly. A bit weird to have a chapter on copyright in the middle of all of these other topics, but oh well.

By the end of this chapter, hopefully you'll be able to... I dunno, the slides don't have an end-of-chapter goal.

Anyway, UI/UX!

It's gotta be *really* important, because we learned this 2 terms ago and it's still here!


In games, *User Experience* refers to the overall quality of the player's interaction while playing the game. This can include emotional and logical responses to the game, it's interface and the player's overall satisfaction.

Of course, UX is really important in making a game actually enjoyable.


Meanwhile, UI is the interactive visual presented in games, such as buttons, info display, icons... You know the schtick.



UX is a human-first way of designing products that considers how the overall experience of using the product is for the user.

UI is the visual elements of an interface. A good UI is part of a good UX experience. Try thinking of this as a square-rectangle relationship, I suppose.

# So, What Makes a Good UX Design?

It has to be usable, equitable, enjoyable and useful.


### Usable...
means that a product is **clear and easy to use**.

### Equitable...
means that the product is designed to be usable to **as many people as possible; a diverse audience**. This means it had to address their needs, as different as they may be from most others.

### Enjoyable...
means that a product is... yeah. **Enjoyable**. This design reflects what the user may be thinking or feeling while using it. A product doesn't have to be enjoyable to be able to be used, but it will heavily enhance a user's experience while using a product.

### Useful...
means that the product solves a user problem. Basically, it solves a problem that the designer has identified successfully. Important to note that Usable and Useful mean two different things. If a product is usable, that doesn't mean it's useful.



### How do we make a good UI?

Know your user-... damn, I was too slow. <sup>24/10</sup>

Anyway,
- Know your user: meaning your target audience and their demographic data, what they need and what stands in their way of getting what they want.
- How people interact with the game UI: How the user is going to interact with the game UI.
- Make a simple decision-making process: creating a simple and intuitive layout with navigation menus and use of content fields.

# Visual Design Principles

We've learnt some of these in Term 1, but now we're gonna see how they apply to games. But first, a recap.


### Balance
Any element on anything places visual weight, due to color, size, texture, etc. It is important to keep a sense of balance when placing these visual weights across a screen.


### Contrast
Contrast is the visual difference between elements in order to create a sense of hierarchy. This can be used to have some parts be more eye-catching.

### Proportion
This is when you, in a way, manipulate an element's size to show it's importance.

### Emphasis
This one is to highlight an especially important element on the screen. 


### Pattern
It's the repetition of more than one design element. This can be used to keep a sense of cohesion while making the screen a lot more uniform and else cluttered than they need to be.

### Repetition
Using repeated elements on a page throughout the design.


### Unity
The principle of harmony produced by all the elements in a design piece. We can achieve this by using similar colors that match with other elements or the rest of the page.



...Can you tell I was rushing to write this as our lecturer blazed through it?




# UI For Games!

There are four types of UI Design for games:
Non-Diegetic, Spatial, Meta and Non-Spatial.


## Non-Diegetic
...is the most common of them. This design is intended to communicate information to the player, and was not made to feel as if they existed in the game's world or canon.


## Diegetic...
is a UI that is made to look like it was entirely part of the game's world or canon, and is usually something that the character would interact with. 



## Meta...
is a UI that fully exists in the game's story, but don't reside in the game's space. The player's character may or may not be aware of these components. These are traditionally used to signify damage to the player (maybe in a blood splat on the screen.)



## Spatial...
is 3D in nature, and is integrated within the game space, but is not seen by the characters and can only be seen by a player. These are often used as visual aids (waypoints, etc.)


Basically, have a look at this table.

## Things To Remember (i copypasted this from the slides guys soz)

- Explain importance of user experience in the game. ​
- The main objective of UX is to maintain players' interest in the game. ​

- Describe the basic principles of design: ​
- Balance, Contrast , Proportion. Emphasis, Pattern, Repetition, Unity ​

- Difference between UI Design and UX design ​
- State the importance of friendly game UI design ​which focuses on the layout of functionality of interfaces, is a subset of user experience design, which focuses on the bigger picture: that is, the whole experience, not just the interface. ​

- The basics of user experience design. - usable, equitable, enjoyable, and useful ​
- UX design framework -empathize , define , ideate , prototype Test​
- UX experiences Should be Types of Game UI -Non-diegetic, Diegetic, Meta, and Spatial.
