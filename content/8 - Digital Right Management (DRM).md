We've touched on this a bit last chapter, so here we go.

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to explain the methods of DRM, for generating/protecting your revenue for digital games.

DRMs are a systematic approach to **protecting digital media with copyright**. It is meant to prevent unauthorised redistribution of digital media (üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è) and restrict the ways consumers can copy content they had purchased.


Types of DRMs in games include:
- Product Keys
- Limited Install Activations
- Persistent Online Authentication
- Runtime Restriction
- Encryption
- Regional Lockout


### Product Keys

A product key, typically a alphanumerical (alphabetic + numerical) string, is used to **represent a license to a particular copy of software**. 

Usually, during the installation process or when launching the game, the user will be prompted to enter a product key. If the entered string is accepted (usually by internal algorithm), the user can continue.

This method can usually be paired with other DRM methods to prevent cracked software to run, or using a Keygen to generate keys.



### Limited Install Activations

Use DRM to limit the number of systems the software can be installed on.
- This requires authentication from the server

Limits users who have more than three or five systems.

Could face problems when the users re-installs or updates the OS



### Persistent Online Activation

Uses **online authentication** to play the game.

Mainstream publishers started relying on online DRMs from **later half of 2008 or early 2009**.

Examples include Ubisoft, Valve, EA



### Runtime Restrictions

Instead of displaying error messages, the user will be bombarded with annoyances that will either discourage them or remove their ability to play the game entirely. These reasons can be... creative, ranging from

- Guns losing their accuracy
- An invisible, invulnerable enemy that will constantly attack the player until they are killed, and...

...what?

- Turning the player into a bird???

The first example listed can be seen in Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis (2001) where the player's guns lose accuracy.


### Encryption

This essentially changes the content such that it is "locked", and cannot be accessed without decryption. This ensures that no other restriction methods can be bypassed by modifying the game's software, so usually this isn't the only DRM method applied.


### Regional Lockout

Regional Lockout can be enforced through physical means, like making a cartridge (or game console) in Japan differently-shaped than from one in Europe, ensuring that you couldn't put a JP cartridge into an EU console.

It could also be done digitally, such as inspecting the user's IP address or using and identifying code. This could also be done unintentionally, such as using devices that introduces region-specific technologies. An example of this is video formats, with NTSC and PAL.





Here's an easy summary to see everything.

I'm getting slightly tired from writing this, but I'll pull on. Next up, Monetisation.
