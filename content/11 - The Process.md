Everything has a process. Game Development is a part of everything. Ergo, Game Development has a process.

Last chapter. By the end of this, on top of everything we've learnt, you should be able to describe the stages of Game Development, as well as state and explain the roles of those involved in the team.

# Intro to Game Development

This is a very lengthy process, usually a few years. Indie games usually take less time, and can be produced cheaply by individuals, or a small group of developers.


This process has three specific phases.

In the first **phase, pitches, prototypes and GDDs** are written. When approved, the developer gains **funding** to develop the game. Then, it's **released**. Easy, right?

# Pre-Production

This is where we deal with the **conceptualisation** and design of the game.



## Concept Development

A game needs an **idea** to be started. This is the blueprint for the **whole game design team**. **Concepts** of the game could be originals, sequels or licensed.

When the idea is finalised, the concept plan is submitted to those making the decisions, and a more **detailed design document** of the game is generated.

This stage is crucial to ensure that designers and developers have the same idea of what the game will turn out to be like.



### Concept Art

This is when designers start designing elements of the game such as enemies, maps, etc.


### Pre-production roles include...

- Primary game developer
	- GDD
	- Feasibility
- Programmers
	- Technical Design Document (TDD)
- Artists
	- Create and visualise ideas and concepts
- Producers
	- Combine all ideas and map out the rest of the project such as costs and timeline.

What is to be done here?
1. Concept/pitching document
2. Licensing permission
3. GDD
4. TDD
5. Art style
6. Prototyping

# Production

This is the bulkiest and most important stage, and *everyone* is in play here.

- Animators and Artists
	- Drawing, Modeling, Texturing, Rigging and Animating visual game assets.
	- Sound Production, where sound effects are recorded and edited for the game.
- Programmers
	- By this point, the programmers would integrate the sounds into the game engine.

	

# Post-Production

When a game is complete, it's not complete yet. Now, it needs to undergo extensive testing, review, marketing and finally, distirbution.


Testers are required to play the game and highlight any bugs found.

- Pre-alpha
	- Activities that are performed during the project prior to the actual testing
- Alpha
	- First phase of testing
- Beta
	- Begins when the features are complete
	- Meant to reduce impact to users
	- Usually done by people outside the organisation


Marketing...
- Occurs even during the development process
- Includes shows and conventions for promotion
- Includes "demos" made to offer a sneak peek of the experience
- is when trailers are released

Basically, building all of the hype up for the game.


**At last, the game development process is accomplished on release of the game.**

## Role Explanation


Producers are
- In charge of overseeing the development
- Managers of the development team as well as schedules, progress reports, staff, etc.
- A senior role, requiring a lot of experience
- Meeting with leads regularly to keep updated on the development status
- NOT A GAME DESIGNER, but needs to ensure the publisher/upper management wishes are included into the final game.


Game designers...
- Design the gameplay mechanics, conceiving the rules and structure of a game
- Drive the production process with their vision
- NOT GAME ARTISTS
- There are also...
	- **Lead Designers**
		- Coordinate the GD team
		- Responsible for documentation
	- **Game Mechanics Designer**
		- Designs and balances the game rules
	- **Level Designer**
		- Creates game environment, levels and missions
	- **Writers**
		- Concieves narrative, dialogue, etc.


Programmers...
- Program the game
- Usually have a background in computer science
- Work in highly specialised fields.
- Has individual disciplines that include:
	- Physics
	- AI
	- Graphics
	- Sound
	- Gameplay
	- Scripting
	- UI
	- Input Processing
	- Network Communications
	- Game Tools

Game Artists...
- Produce game assets
	- 3D, 2D, UI, textures, etc.
- Individual roles include:
	- Modellers
	- Animators
	- Texture Artists
	- Motion Capture Specialists
	- UI Artists

Sound Engineers...
- Are technical professionals responsible for sound effects and positioning.
- May oversee voice acting and sound asset creation.
- Composers who create the musical score or soundtrack are often outsourced.

Game Testers...
- Carry out quality assurance.
- Ensure that the game falls within the proposed design. This involves...
	- **Design** elements such as **features, compatibility, localisation**.
	- **Technical** matters, such as **mistakes or flaws**, more commonly knows as **bugs**.
- Are given the Alpha version of the game first.
	- When all major bugs are resolved, the Beta version can be sent out, sometimes to the public for public testing.
	- During the testing phase, a copy will be sent out to ESRB to be given a consumer rating.



And finally, a picture to summarise everything above, pulled from the slides, of course.
