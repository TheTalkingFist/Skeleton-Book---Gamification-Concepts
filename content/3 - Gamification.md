Remember when your teacher gave you star stickers when you did something that made them happy? Yeah, that's gamification.

More specifically, gamification is when someone applies **game design principles, concepts, mechanics and elements** into a non-game concept, such as the example above, in class.

We do this, just to make things **more entertaining and enjoyable** to do.


### Why do we gamify?

- Enhancing Engagement
	- We do it to enhance engagement and keep people captivated in doing the task, or playing the game.
- Motivating Players
	- Gamification provides players with clear goals, a sense of reward as well as a clear path on how to get it. This gives an intrinsic motivation to keep players engaged and motivated to keep going.
- Creating a Sense of Achievement
	- Gamified tasks (or games themselves) usually give a structured environment catered for a person's success. This gives players a meaningful sense of progression and purpose.
- Fostering Competition
	- Leaderboards, challenges and highest records can foster a sense of competition within players, giving them the want to perform the best they can, even in some cases against themselves.
- Enhancing Learning and Skill Development
	- Gamification can be used to facilitate learning and skill development in games.
- Improving User Retention and Monetisation
	- Using gamification, we can basically keep 'em coming back to our game. If our game has a freemium or microtransaction system, we can keep 'em spending.
- Enhancing User Experience
	- Gamification elements can be used to create a more enjoyable experience overall.

### What has been Gamified? (Examples)

Gym or Fitness apps usually include a few gamified concepts to keep users engaged with their app and motivate them to exercise regularly. A few examples include Progress Bars, Points, Badges and Social Interaction.


The education department has seen their fair share of gamification, too. Perhaps the most popular example of this is Kahoot!.


You can also see Gamification concepts for Employee Training. Employers can use Gamification concepts to make their training programs a lot more engaging and fun. They could use badges and levels for their modules.

A slightly more "corpo" example of Gamification is a Customer Loyalty programme.
