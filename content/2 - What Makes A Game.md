People make a game. Usually, people have specific ideas in mind when making a game, and that's what we're talking about here.

By the end of this topic, hopefully you could **state the characteristics of video games**, and **list examples of good-selling ones** <sub>(though, admittedly, you should be able to do the latter without reading this this topic).</sub>

# Mechanics. Aesthetic. Story. Technology. Long Ago, All Four Nations Lived In Harmony...

...and they still do.

These are the Four Basic Elements of a video game:
- Mechanics
- Aesthetic
- Story
- Technology

M.A.S.T... Cool acronym.


Put a pin in that for now, we'll talk about later. First, though, let's talk about entertainment.

# Entertainment, Linear v Non-Linear

There was a guy, named Chris Crawford. In 1997, he published The Art of Computer Game Design. In it, he talks about two forms of entertainment mediums: The **Linear**, and the **Non-Linear**.

**Linear** entertainment involves aesthetics, story and technology. Important though, is that it **does not involve mechanics**, and hence **does not provide a path of interaction between the medium and the user.**

Examples of Linear entertainment include:
- Movies
	- Go to a fixed location, with a fixed show, with a fixed plot.
- Broadcast TV
	- Television programming with fixed schedules
- Books
	- Written beforehand to give information

The common theme of these is that the information that the mediums give you are **fixed/predetermined**, meaning that you **cannot** change them in any way, shape or form while consuming it.
<sub>(by consuming, I mean taking in the media in your head... please don't eat books.)</sub>



On the other hand...

Examples of **Non-Linear** entertainment include:
- Video Games
	- ...where you can decide on how you want to beat an enemy or level
- Board Games
	- ...where the outcome is decided when people win or get eliminated

These entertainment mediums let you decide how you want to play, or what the outcome would be. They are **not predetermined,** and can happen or end in various ways.

Remember M.A.S.T? Yeah, we're diving deeper into that now.

# Characteristics Of a Good Video Game

## Mechanics

The rule of the game.

Mechanics cover the game procedures as well as the goal, and how and how not to achieve it, AKA Win-Lose conditions.

**Technology** is needed to support these mechanics.

**Aesthetics** help emphasise mechanics.

A good **story** can make sense of unorthodox mechanics.


## Aesthetic

How the game feels.

Aesthetic refers to the Look, Sound and Feel<sup>TM</sup> of the game, which is important to the entire atmosphere.

Audio can be an especially enhance the mood of the game, and could even be a part of the game mechanic. 


## Story

The narrative of the game.

The story refers to the sequence of events that unfold in the game. They can be linear or emergent/branching.

A Story could be complemented by suitable **mechanics**. **Aesthetics** can also help tell and reinforce the story.

We could also use **Technology** to suit the story.


## Technology

The game platforms

This refers to the materials and interactions used to make the game, as well as what platforms the game will be on.

It is the medium where:
- **aesthetics** take place
- **mechanics** occur
- the **story** will be told

It could also prohibit and enable certain aspects of a game.

# We watched a video of Space Invaders (1978)

The gameplay was exciting and well balanced.
- The player shoots and the enemies shoot back while advancing.
- Shields are provided for the player to take cover, but can be slowly destroyed by the aliens.


Enemies have a 2-frame marching animation.
- Background music played, sped up as the enemies got closer (heartbeat?)
- Enhanced playing experience, gave a sense of urgency

Aesthetic
- Simple graphics
- Aliens are color coded, signaled matching points and ferocity

Technology
- Motherboard was custom-made for this game.

That should just about be it for this chapter. Next, we'll be talking about Gamification.
