## What is Market Research?

Market research is a regular design, collection and **analysis of data and findings** that help a **marketing situation** that an organisation is facing.

The main target of market research is **finding out the wants and needs** of real customers, as in finding a real **customer need/market** for the proposed game.



## Why's it good, anyway?

First, let's talk about why *research* is important.

Research is important as...
- it's critical to us making **good decisions**. It gives us a picture of what is occuring, likely to occur in the future; **Data**. 

- Alongside that, it also offers **alternatives** that can be made. 

- It's been proven throughout history that decisions are less risky when we have **multiple options, with the support of research backing our findings.**


We can apply these to Market Research.
- Marketing decisions need the support of research...
	- as proof to customers that our methods are sound, and
	- to stand up to competition and other external pressures.

- **A quick search on the internet** will provide the information we need, and could **save us a lot of time and money**. <sup>Isn't technology just great?</sup>

- And there are times when more **elaborate research**, and an **understanding for the right way to conduct research**, is important.
	- Performing the work themselves, or hiring someone else to do it, could **increase the effectiveness** of these projects.

That should be it for the first chapter. See you in the second one, where we'll talk about what makes a game a game.
