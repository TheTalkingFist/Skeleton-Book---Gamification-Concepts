Hopefully, by the end, you'll be able to state the major game platforms and explain their features

---

A game platform refers to the medium you are playing the game on. They mostly consist of:

- Console
- PC
- Mobile
- Handheld

## Consoles
Systems made specifically made for playing video games.

They give the *advantage* that their **hardware is static**, meaning that games were made specifically to be run on the console. That way, consoles are usually **guaranteed to be able to run** most, if not all games that are offered on it.

Also, chances are their hardware won't need to be **updated for a couple of years**. As well, all changes made between consoles are purely cosmetic. For example, the Switch, Switch Lite and Limited Editions.

However, they require some sort of **external screen**.


## PC (Usually Windows)
Very customisable, not always just for games.

It does not need to run AAA games. Some simple, lightweight 2D games could work.

They also offer a wide range of services to get your games from, such as **websites and servers** like Steam or GOG.


**No two PCs are the same**, so there is a very wide range of devices.

Requires **a mouse and keyboard**, as well as an **external monitor**.



## Handheld
**Lightweight** console devices for playing video games, made with **portability** in mind.

They're portable, and all of their parts are made a **part of a single unit**.

However, **each device is very different** in terms of developing games made for their specs and features. For example, the NDS has a stylus and touch screen, which might not be compatible with something like a PSP.

However, there's a special case for handhelds...
### The Switch
The ability to 'switch' from handheld to home console makes it a sort of hybrid, and comes at the cost of some processing power




## Mobile Devices
Games played on a **smartphone, PDA, etc.**


Advantages for these is that they have the **largest area of growth**. They also have a rise in digital storefronts, shown in the App Store and Google Play Store which act as a centralised download service for other apps.

Most are free, but they also have tons of ads for extra revenue..





## Cross-Platform
Refers to games released on a range of platforms.

Some games are not able to be cross-platform, due to business reasons. For example, Disney has a game collab with Square Enix, who also has a collab with Sony.

If Disney licensed a game, maybe Kingdom Hearts, with Sony (and Square Enix) they'll have to release it exclusively for the Playstation consoles, either for a short amount of time or indefinitely. This, of course, prohibits cross-platform.

...Wait, that's it? Okay then. A pretty short chapter, I suppose.
