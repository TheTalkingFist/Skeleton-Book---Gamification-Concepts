I'm not sure if this will even see the light of day... Or rather, the light of anywhere else that isn't my computer. 

So, if you are seeing this, here's a disclaimer: As I'm rushing this, on the 25th of November, around 3 days before our exam, I am writing this more for myself than anything else.

If this does get uploaded, then hopefully this would be useful to you, but I wouldn't count on it. A lot of these are just lifted from the PowerPoints, maybe paraphrased in a way that I could understand easier, and with a little bit of snark and humor I injected in just for fun.
